    "## Strengths  \n",
    "One of my main strengths is **problem-solving**. When debugging my code, I usually have a general idea of what to look for and systematically test potential issues using the console. If needed, I also use **Postman** to troubleshoot API requests and ensure my code functions correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses  \n",
    "One major weakness is that I sometimes **struggle with understanding my own code**, especially in the numerous functions within my frontend. This happens due to a **lack of comments**, making it difficult to navigate my logic when I encounter roadblocks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How I Can Improve  \n",
    "- Develop the habit of **writing comments** to briefly explain what each function does.  \n",
    "- Add comments within complex functions to **clarify specific parts of the logic**.  \n",
    "- Avoid relying solely on function names, as they may not always provide enough context.  \n"
