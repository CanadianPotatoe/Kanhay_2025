    "# 5 Key Contributions Over 12 Weeks  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dynamic Theme Management (CRUD Operations)  \n",
    "[CRUD Implementation](https://canadianpotatoe.github.io/Kanhay_2025/csp/CRUD)  \n",
    "I designed an interactive UI color-switching system to enhance user engagement. While default themes were available, I implemented a frontend color picker and a theme template, allowing each user to have a personalized theme. Users could update their themes seamlessly, and the frontend dynamically read and displayed these changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Deployment Administration  \n",
    "As the team's Deployment Admin, I was responsible for successfully deploying our frontend. I first troubleshot and resolved local build issues that were preventing deployment. Once the build was stable, I used Cockpit to deploy the website efficiently, ensuring a smooth launch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Deployment Blog  \n",
    "[Deployment Blog](https://dnhs-neptune.github.io/neptune_frontend/deployment)  \n",
    "To support my team, I created a detailed deployment blog documenting the challenges I encountered and their solutions. I also included issues faced by my teammates and provided clear instructions on updating backend code. This allowed the team to work independently without relying solely on me for future updates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Agile Methodology Implementation  \n",
    "[User Story & Agile Planning](https://github.com/DNHS-Neptune/neptune_frontend/issues/6)  \n",
    "At the start of the trimester, I developed a **User Story** to outline my feature goals and execution plan. I then maintained a **burndown list** and a **Kanban board** to systematically track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay organized throughout development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Issue Tracking and Project Management  \n",
    "- [Burndown List](https://github.com/DNHS-Neptune/neptune_frontend/issues/29)  \n",

    "- [Self-Assessment](https://github.com/DNHS-Neptune/neptune_frontend/issues/23)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To stay accountable and structured, I created various **GitHub Issues**, including one for my **User Story**, issues for specific features, burndown lists, and even a **self-assessment issue** to reflect on my progress. This method helped streamline development and ensure no tasks were overlooked.  \n"

    "### **Next Steps for the Theme Feature**  \n",
    "Currently, the **theme system only updates the profile page**, but it does not apply to other pages of the website. The next step in improving this feature is to create a **global stylesheet** that ensures the selected theme is applied consistently across the entire site.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Planned Improvements**  \n",
    "- Ensure the **theme settings are fetched and applied** on every page the user visits.  \n",
    "- Implement a **global theme system** that affects all pages dynamically.  \n",
