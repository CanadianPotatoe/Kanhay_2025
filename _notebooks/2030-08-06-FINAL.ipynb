    "CrossWise is a smart web application that provides intelligent border wait time predictions for the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa ports of entry between San Diego and Tijuana. The project uses machine learning algorithms trained on historical and real-time data to help users plan more efficient border crossings. I contributed by initially attempting to use a machine learning model to predict the weather, but ultimately pivoted to NOAA's API for reliable forecasting. I also designed and developed a clean, aesthetic frontend weather page to display the results clearly and accessibly.\n",
