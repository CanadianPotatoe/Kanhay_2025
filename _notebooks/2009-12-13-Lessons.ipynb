    "\n",
    "- **Mitigation phases**\n",
    "  1. Pre‑processing: diversify and clean data\n",
    "  2. In‑processing: adjust during training (e.g. synthetic samples)\n",
    "  3. Post‑processing: monitor and correct outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Crowdsourcing & Distributed Computing\n",
    "- **Crowdsourcing types**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Data crowdsourcing**: Wikipedia edits, traffic reports (Waze), Mechanical Turk\n",
    "- **Distributed computing examples**: SETI@home, Bitcoin mining, cloud services (AWS)\n",
    "- **Benefits & challenges**: diversity & scale vs. quality control, privacy, coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Legal & Ethical Concerns in CS\n",
    "- **Intellectual Property**\n",
    "  - **Copyright**, **patents**, **trademarks**, **trade secrets**\n",
    "  \n",
    "| License | Permissions | Restrictions | Best Use |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **MIT** | Free to use, modify, distribute (with credit) | No liability/warranty | Great for small projects, web tools |\n",
    "| **Apache 2.0** | Same as MIT + patent protection | Must include license/notice | Corporate/open-source APIs |\n",
    "| **GPL (General Public License)** | Free use, but derivatives must stay open-source | Cannot make proprietary forks | Nonprofits, community software |\n",
    "| **BSD 3-Clause** | Use freely (even in closed-source), must not misrepresent authorship | No warranty | Academic tools, closed-source apps |\n",
    "| **Creative Commons (CC0, CC-BY)** | Mostly for non-code works (e.g., docs, images) | Some versions require attribution | Artwork, documentation |\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ethical issues**\n",
    "  - Plagiarism vs. proper attribution\n",
    "  - Commercial exploitation of open‑source\n",
    "  - Respecting author intent & license terms\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Safe Computing\n",
    "- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: SSNs, emails, driver’s licenses\n",
    "- **Cookies**: session vs. persistent; first‑party vs. third‑party\n",
    "- **Passwords**: length, case, digits, specials\n",
    "- **Encryption**\n",
    "  - Symmetric (AES) vs. Asymmetric (RSA) vs. Hashing (SHA‑256)\n",
    "- **Phishing**: email, website spoofing, smishing; always verify URLs & senders\n",
    "- **Verification**: MFA, digital signatures, CAPTCHA\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Binary Search Algorithm\n",
    "- **Binary vs. Linear Search**\n",
    "  - Requires **sorted** list; cuts search space in half → O(log n)\n",
    "  - Linear is O(n), but works unsorted\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps**\n",
    "  1. Compare target to middle element\n",
    "  2. Recurse on left or right half\n",
    "  3. Stop when found or bounds cross\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real‑world uses**: dictionaries, databases, search indices\n",

    "- **Lists**: ordered, mutable collections (e.g. shopping cart, email inbox)\n",
    "- **Common operations**: append, insert, remove, pop, slice, sort, reverse, len\n",
    "- **Traversal**: `for item in list:` → process each element\n",
    "- **Filtering**: loop + condition → build new list of matches (e.g. even numbers)\n",
    "- **Applications**: database query filters, search‑as‑you‑type\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Random Number Generation\n",
    "- **Purpose**: simulations, games, security, testing\n",
    "- **Function**: `random(a, b)` → uniform integer in [a, b]\n",

    "- **Why Efficiency Matters**  \n",
    "  - Faster user experiences, lower resource use, and better scalability.  \n",
    "  - Crucial on mobile or high‑load servers; every ms and MB counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Big O Notation**  \n",
    "  - Describes how time/space grows with input size.  \n",
    "  - Focuses on worst‑case, ignores constants (e.g., O(n + 5) → O(n)).  \n",
    "  - Common classes:\n",
    "    - **O(1)**: constant (e.g., array lookup)\n",
    "    - **O(log n)**: logarithmic (binary search)\n",
    "    - **O(n)**: linear (simple loops)\n",
    "    - **O(n log n)**: linearithmic (merge sort, quicksort)\n",
