The installation of all the tools was fairly easy, once I found the proper documentation. I didnt struggle to install WSL, but I did originally try to install all the needed applications manually through WSL, but later on, I found out that I had to clone a github repository, and then run a script which would download everything that I needed. Overall, after finding the proper documentation, the installation process was fairly easy.
